#Data set
The data set includes the following files:
* Run_analysis.R: an R script that performs the analysis of the given data
* README.md: the readme file with the general informations.
* averageData.txt: this .txt file contains the output of the Run_analysis.R script. It containts the metadata with the averages of the mean and standard deviations(std) variables of the experiments.
* CodeBook.md: text with the additional information of the analysis.

#Variables
* `TestX`,`TestY`,`TrainX`,`TrainY`,`TestSubject`,`TrainSubject` contans the data from the downloaded files.
